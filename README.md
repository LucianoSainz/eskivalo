# welcome to my project done for ironhack
I had to create a project of a game made with canvas, HTML, CSS, Javascript, within a week that I had to present in ironhack.

# Game :
The game is called **Eskivalo**, it is a spaceship that must avoid obstacles such as meteorites and shoot satellites & add points, trying not to destroy our ship.

##  Experience :
  
It was an intense week, divided by tasks to be performed by days, each day towards a different part of the game. The truth is learned a lot by performing this type of practice that lets you demonstrate what you have learned and you learn many new things that are generated at the code level.
